# Changelog

Each version is frozen on a `release/vN` branch. `main` is the live site, and the automatic activity logs and new videos land there between versions.

## v3 (2026-11-05)

A full redesign into a platform-style app called Built.

- App layout: a sidebar on desktop with icons, live counts for each section, a 48-day sprint ring, and your profile. On phones a floating bottom bar replaces the sidebar.
- Sticky top bar with the page title, a live date and time, a GitHub link, and a light or dark switch that is remembered.
- Goals opens with a greeting hero and a "Focus today" panel showing the goal due today and its next step.
- Goal countdowns are now rings that empty as time runs out (hours on the due day, days otherwise).
- New visual system: glass cards, soft glow background with a faint grid, Geist and Geist Mono type, gradient accents, smooth tab transitions, and hover states everywhere.
- Learning opens on Completed when nothing is half-watched.

## v2.1 (2026-11-05)

- Removed the four summary cards from the top of the Goals tab, so the goal cards come first.

## v2 (2026-11-05)

New look and a goal dashboard.

- New Goals tab, now the first thing you see. Each goal shows a live countdown (hours left on the due day, days left otherwise), progress from its milestones, time used, and a milestone checklist.
- Two goals: finish CampusX evals (due Nov 5) and get an AI engineer job (Nov 5 to Dec 5), with applications, interviews, offers and interview videos counted. The interview-video count and the "watch 30 videos" milestone update by themselves from the Learning tab.
- Redesign: indigo and violet palette in light and dark, gradient title, softer cards with shadows, and a pill-style tab bar that stays at the top while you scroll.

## v1 (2026-11-05)

The first saved version, covering everything built so far.

- Dashboard with streak stats, a 48-day build plan (Oct 25 to Dec 11, 2026) and a categorized table of every project.
- Automatic updates every 4 hours from public GitHub commits, which log each day as Done, Today or Missed and add new repos.
- Home-screen app for iPhone and Android: install prompt, icons, and offline support.
- Learning tab for YouTube AI-engineering study, with three lists: In progress (half-watched videos and where you stopped), Completed (grouped by tracker, numbered, with the completion date) and Course trackers.
- Trackers: CampusX 100 Days of Machine Learning, and 100 AI engineer interview videos.
- Parked native app source (Expo) in `app/`.
